# 🎓 SmartFit-Student: AI-Powered Fitness Planner

**Capstone Project for EDUNET FOUNDATION – IBM SKILLSBUILD | Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Internship**

SmartFit-Student is a **constraint-aware, explainable AI fitness planner** designed specifically for college students. Unlike generic fitness apps, it adapts workout and meal plans based on **academic workload, time availability, food access, budget, and equipment**, ensuring realism and consistency.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User provides basic profile and constraints
2. System dynamically selects a supported Gemini model
3. AI generates:

   * Personalized workout plan
   * Practical meal strategy
   * Explanation of decisions
   * Fallback options
   * Micro-habits for consistency

## 🌟 What Makes This Project Unique

* Designed **exclusively for students**
* Considers **real-world constraints**, not ideal scenarios
* Dynamically handles AI model availability for reliability
* Focus on **sustainability, not intensity**

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* College students with busy academic schedules
* Hostel students with limited food choices
* Beginners starting fitness without gym access

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Weekly progress tracking
* PDF export of fitness plans
* Hostel-specific day-wise meal mapping
* Integration with wearable data

---

## 🧠 Academic Context

This project demonstrates the practical application of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts** in building **real-world, user-centric systems**, aligning with the goals of the **EDUNET Foundation – IBM SkillsBuild Internship Program**.
